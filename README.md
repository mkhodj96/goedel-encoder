# goedel-encoder
# Tool for Symbolic Encoding and Analysis of Mathematical Algorithms

This project implements a **tool for encoding, analyzing, and interpreting mathematical algorithms** using Gödel numbering and pairing functions. It demonstrates how symbolic representations can be mapped to numeric encodings, facilitating algorithmic analysis in theoretical computer science and mathematical logic.

## Key Concepts

### Gödel Numbering
Gödel numbering is a method of encoding mathematical expressions as unique integers. Each expression or variable is mapped using prime factorization:
\[
n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot \dots \cdot p_k^{e_k}
\]
where \( p_1, p_2, \dots \) are prime numbers, and \( e_1, e_2, \dots \) are the encoded components of the expression.

### Pairing Functions
Pairing functions are mathematical tools used to encode two or more integers into a single integer. This project uses **Cantor pairing** and recursive extensions:
1. **Pairing two integers**:
   \[
   \pi(x, y) = 2^x \cdot (2y + 1) - 1
   \]
2. **Pairing three integers**:
   \[
   \pi_3(x, y, z) = \pi(x, \pi(y, z))
   \]

These functions ensure unique and reversible encodings.

## Features

### Gödel Encoding
- **Encoding an Integer**:  
  The `Godel_Num1` method converts a number into its prime factor exponents, representing its Gödel encoding.

- **Decoding Gödel Numbers**:  
  The `Godel_Num2` method reconstructs an integer from its Gödel encoding.

### Pairing and Unpairing
- **Pair Two or Three Values**:  
  Encode two or three integers into a single unique value using the `Pairing2` and `Pairing3` methods.
  
- **Unpair Values**:  
  Decode a paired integer back into its original components.

### Symbolic Variable and Label Representation
- Convert integers into symbolic representations of variables (e.g., \( x, y, z \)) and labels (e.g., \( A1, B2 \)).
- Support for programmatic representation of instructions using Gödel numbering.

### Generate and Interpret Encoded Programs
- **Instruction Representation**:  
  Symbolically encode instructions like assignment, incrementation, decrementation, and conditional jumps.
  
- **Program Analysis**:  
  Decode encoded integers back into symbolic program instructions for analysis.

## Example Usage

### Gödel Encoding
Input: \( n = 120 \)  
Output: \( [3, 1, 0] \) (corresponding to \( 2^3 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^0 \))

### Pairing Function
Input: \( x = 3, y = 5 \)  
Output: \( 2^3 \cdot (2 \cdot 5 + 1) - 1 = 95 \)

### Program Decoding
Encoded Input: \( [3, 1, 0] \)  
Output:  
```
Instruction 1: y <-- y
Instruction 2: x1 <-- x1 + 1
```
